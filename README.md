A platform where you can share access to your telepresence robot without worrying about networking/communication protocols. Just build your bot, flash our code onto your microcontroller, and you're ready to go! Tutorial coming soon. **Please note that webRTC is currently not functioning properly on iOS.

TODO:

-payment system that enables owners to charge for access to their robot

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~most likely a token-based system (users buys tokens | owners charge x amount of tokens per min)
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~potentially a cryptocurrency-based system using javascript frameworks (plus robot to robot payments using NFC?)
  
-webrtc client implementation for Raspberry Pi

-bigger & better telepresence robots
