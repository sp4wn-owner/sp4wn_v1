A platform where you can share access to your telepresence robot without worrying about networking/communication protocols. Just build your bot, flash our code onto your microcontroller, and you're ready to go! Tutorial coming soon. 

TODO:
-user registration/authentication system
-webrtc implementation for raspberry pi for quick deployment and easy customization
-payment system that enables owners to charge for access to their robot
  ~most likely a token-based system (users buys tokens | owners charge x amount of tokens per min)
  ~potentially a cryptocurrency-based system using javascript frameworks
-bigger & better telepresence robots
  ~Sythentic muscles?
