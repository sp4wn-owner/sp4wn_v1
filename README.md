A platform where you can share access to your telepresence robot without worrying about networking/communication protocols. Just build your bot, flash our code onto your microcontroller, and you're ready to go! Tutorial coming soon. **Please note that webRTC is currently not functioning properly on iOS.

TODO:

-webrtc robot client implementation for Raspberry Pi

-24/7 robots for demonstration purposes
  
-bigger & better telepresence robots

~potentially a cryptocurrency-based system (robot to robot payments using NFC?)
